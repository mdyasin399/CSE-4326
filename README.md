Autonomous Office Delivery System: A Path-Following Robot for Documents and Parcels

In modern office environments, manual delivery of documents and parcels can be time-consuming and inefficient, reducing overall productivity. Employees often need to leave their workstations to handle deliveries, which disrupts their workflow. Automating this process with a smart, autonomous robot can streamline office logistics, ensuring timely and efficient delivery of items without human intervention. Our proposed solution is a path-following robot powered by a Raspberry Pi, which autonomously navigates through office spaces using a camera and computer vision algorithms. It follows predefined paths to deliver documents and parcels to specific locations, improving efficiency and minimizing human involvement in the delivery process. The robot demonstrated a high accuracy in path-following, successfully navigating predefined routes with over 95\% precision during testing. Its obstacle avoidance system, utilizing ultrasonic sensors, efficiently detected and rerouted around obstacles with a response time of less than 0.5 seconds, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted delivery operations.

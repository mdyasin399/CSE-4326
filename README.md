Autonomous Office Delivery System: A Path-Following Robot for Documents and Parcels

This project involves the design and implementation of an autonomous, path-following robot built to deliver documents and parcels within an office environment. The robot is powered by a Raspberry Pi and equipped with various sensors, a camera, and a Python-based line-following algorithm. It efficiently navigates predefined paths, avoids obstacles, and provides a user-friendly interface for employees to request deliveries.


Features:
1. Autonomous Path Navigation: Uses computer vision and a line-following algorithm to navigate through the office.
2. Obstacle Detection and Avoidance: Equipped with ultrasonic sensors for real-time obstacle detection and rerouting.
3. RFID Access Control: Utilizes RFID for secure access to specific areas.
4. Automated Parcel Handling: Servo-controlled compartment for loading and unloading documents or parcels.
5. User-Friendly Interface: Simple interface for employees to select delivery or pick-up points.
6. Visual and Audio Feedback: Neopixel LED for visual feedback and a buzzer for audio signals.
7. OLED Display: Displays real-time status and feedback.

**Autonomous Office Delivery System: A Path-Following Robot for Documents and Parcels üåü**
Facilitating efficient and autonomous document and parcel delivery within office spaces

## Welcome to the Smart Robot for Office Document and Parcel Delivery project! This platform automates the delivery process, allowing office employees to send and receive documents or parcels seamlessly. Built with a Raspberry Pi and powered by a path-following algorithm, this robot offers a streamlined, scalable solution for office logistics.

## üöÄ Key Features:
Autonomous Navigation: The robot follows predefined paths using a camera and a Python-based line-following algorithm.
Obstacle Detection: Equipped with ultrasonic sensors, the robot avoids obstacles in real time, ensuring safe and efficient deliveries.
RFID Access: Secure delivery to specific office locations using RFID technology.
Parcel Handling: Servo-operated compartments allow for easy loading and unloading of documents and parcels.
Visual and Audio Feedback: Neopixel LEDs and a buzzer provide status updates and feedback to users.
OLED Display: Displays real-time information about the robot‚Äôs operations and progress.
ü§ù For Users:
Track Deliveries: Users can easily monitor and control the robot‚Äôs activities, ensuring their documents or parcels are delivered to the correct location.
Interactive Interface: Employees can select predefined drop-off and pick-up points using a user-friendly interface.
üè¢ For Offices:
Efficient Document Handling: The robot saves time by automating document and parcel deliveries, enhancing overall workplace productivity.
Scalability: The system is easily adaptable for various office layouts and can be scaled to accommodate larger office spaces.
